# project-1

Proposal: 
Our project is to uncover and analyze the impact of COVID19 on use of the City of Chicago Transit Authority from Jan 1, 2019 to May 31, 2021. We will use 2019 as a control group, 2020 as our year of COVID-impact, and 2021 to date to see how trends of use have shifted as vaccination has been available.
